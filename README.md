# Gravity

A set of modular SCSS components that can be used for building responsive websites.

Unlike bigger frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation, Gravity is very minimal. 

It gives you the essential components (grids, mixins, good default styles) without including a ton of stuff you don't need.

## Modules

+ Base (essential styles, reset etc)
+ Grid (grids via neat)
+ Typography (headings, paragraphs, website typography)
+ Components (styling for tables, forms, buttons etc )

## Use

This framework requires Ruby.

Installing required modules (bourbon and neat)

```
bundle
rake gravity:install
```

## Updating

To update the framework run

```
rake gravity:update
```
