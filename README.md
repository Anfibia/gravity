# Gravity

A set of modular SCSS components that can be used for building responsive websites.

Unlike bigger frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation, Gravity is very minimal. 

It gives you the essential components (grids, mixins, good default styles) without including a ton of stuff you don't need.

Gravity uses bourbon for mixins and neat for grids
