Inspired by many great people and projects.

A powerful boilerplate framework for building HTML5 websites that uses SASS as the core styling engine. 
Gravity will drastically reduce the time needed to take a design from concept to working model. It enforces best practices at every stage.

In my opinion, Gravity based websites are easier to maintain, and therefore this framework can help you drastically improve your teams workflow and profitability.

Mobile support/version coming soon.

You need SASS installed http://sass-lang.com

MAC OSX

1. mkdir myproject
2. cd myproject
3. Copy the framework into your new project directory
4. Run this command in the terminal: sass --watch stylesheets:stylesheets
