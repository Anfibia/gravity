## Why another CSS framework? 

Gravity is a modular SCSS framework for building better responsive websites. This means you can choose only the parts you need and also be sure that you start every project with a very solid foundation. Using SASS makes your CSS much cleaner and easier to maintain. Gravity will help you rapidly prototype rock solid websites that work in all web browsers.
