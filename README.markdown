Gravity is a powerful boilerplate framework for building HTML5 websites. It uses SASS and HAML in place of CSS and HTML5. 

Gravity will drastically reduce the time needed to take a design from concept to working model. It enforces best practices at every stage. Gravity based websites are easier to maintain, and therefore this framework can help you drastically improve your teams workflow and profitability.

##Mixin Syntax

Gravity comes with a wide range of useful CSS3 mixins. Tired of writing multiple lines of vendor specific CSS? So were we. You can now add cross browser CSS3 to your projects with one line.

@include rounded(10px)

##Installing Gravity

You need SASS installed http://sass-lang.com and ideally HAML. (gem install haml)

MAC OSX

1. mkdir myproject
2. cd myproject
3. Copy the framework into your new project directory
4. Run this command in the terminal: sass --watch stylesheets:stylesheets
